# Reinforcement-learning-with-Pytorch
* Using Pytorch to implement Reinforcement learning demo.
* Using Pytorch to implement Reinforcement learning demo. The initial Tensorflow version is created by Morvan, reference to https://github.com/MorvanZhou/Reinforcement-learning-with-tensorflow
* I only implement some demo, not all demo.

# Environment
* pytorch, Tkinter, OpenAI gym

# Run
* Unlike tensorflow implemention, every python script is a independent program, just run it!
